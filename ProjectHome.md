This is the working repository for the PILED development board. Feel free to take a look and play around with the files here - however, things may be poorly documented, unfinished, or just not work. Once this code is at a level suitable for release, it will be available for download directly from the LIB3 website.

The PILED Development System is an MSP430 based development board with integrated MOSFET  high current LED drivers, bluetooth communication, linear potentiometers, buttons, and a microphone.
